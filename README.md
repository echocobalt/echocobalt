helloWorld... I'm **Ray Cullen** (~16.7)... a fellow INFP (I've said that a lot now)---who overthinks a lot... 
I love [movies](https://letterboxd.com/theboltman) ... and [musics](https://open.spotify.com/user/314gmrlol6yxrjje3gwmynk4cf4y) ...
 and I love ellipsis...

```json
{
    "name": "Ray Cullen",
    "age": 16.7,
    "loves": ["movies", "musics", "computerSci", "camelCase", "courierNew", "sleepin'", "ethanHunt"],

}
```
Mr. Voorhess still comes in my mind when I write json

I honestly don't know what to write here... but here are the worst things that ever happened to me... being born, ADHD, and that 6th grade crush... and the fact that she's still in my class...

I wanted to write more things... but I'm yawning all over, stressing about the exams, and for some reason... I nuked my Fedora and jumped to Endeavour this morning... I so miss those good ol' Win11 days... anyways... I might not finish them repos I just created anytime soon... there's just a lot on the plate right meow...
